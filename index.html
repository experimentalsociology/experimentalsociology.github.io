    <h2>2nd Experimental Sociology Workshop (June 16-17 2022)</h2>
    <p>
        The growing interest in causal explanations and social mechanisms through well-constructed sociological theories has motivated many researchers to turn to experimental research design to advance empirical knowledge. 
        This workshop will provide a platform for researchers to discuss their new experimental research in sociology. We especially encourage contributions from early career researchers. 
        There will be a dedicated discussant for each extended abstract, as well as open floor discussion. 
        Extended abstracts (1250 words max.) are invited on a wide range of research topics in sociology, using field, laboratory, natural, and survey experiments.

    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop hosts a keynote speech delivered by Arnout van de Rijt (EUI). The event will take place online without registration fee. 
        We hope that this online workshop provides early career sociologists, as well as senior scholars, with a platform to discuss their new experimental research ideas and build a network among experimentalists. 
        Please submit your extended abstract to –especially the studies that are yet to be pre-registered are welcome–
        <a href="mailto:sociologyexperimental@gmail.com? subject=Submission: Workshop on Experimental Sociology">this address</a>. 
        
        In the case of multiple-authored papers, indicate who will present. Please also indicate if you are interested in being a discussant in the workshop. 
        The authors will be notified about the outcome of their submission in late May. The detailed schedule of the workshop will be announced in early June.
